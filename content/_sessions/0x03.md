IUSEC had the privilege of hosting two special guest speakers, Matt Dunwoodie and Lukasz Gogolkiewicz from [Context](https://www.contextis.com/en/), at our Week 7 club session this past week.

Matt and Lukasz were candid about their journey through the industry, gave insight into how to successfully navigate our way towards a job, and detailed the realities of the #cyber industry.

Thank you Matt and Lukasz for taking the time to come and visit us on-campus!
